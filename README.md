# Northwind Database Analysis

The Northwind database is a sample database used by Microsoft that contains the sales data for Northwind Traders, a fictitious specialty foods export/import company. The database can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-samples/tree/master/samples/databases/northwind-pubs).

The Northwind sample database includes 14 tables, which are represented by the relationshop diagram below.

In this project, my goal was to perform an analysis of the company Northwind Traders through SQL Server. I chose to analyze some relevant topics of the specific themes below:

ðŸ”¹ [Orders and Sazonality](https://github.com/marianamannes/northwind-database-analysis/tree/main/orders%20and%20sazonality)

ðŸ”¹ [Products and Categories](https://github.com/marianamannes/northwind-database-analysis/tree/main/products%20and%20categories)

ðŸ”¹ [Customers and Employees](https://github.com/marianamannes/northwind-database-analysis/tree/main/customers%20and%20employees)
